  "richText": "Substrate is a framework for building upgradable, modular and efficient blockchains. **FRAME** is a system for building Substrate runtimes. The `Substrate Tooling` project page groups tools that have a positive impact on developer success in the Polkadot Ecosystem.\n\nUnified repositories:\n\n- `Substrate API Sidecar`: REST service that makes it easy to interact with blockchain nodes built using Substrate's FRAME framework. Developed by Parity in **Typescript**.\n- `Substrate Telemetry`: Polkadot Telemetry service. Developed by Parity in **Rust** and **Typescript**.\n- `Substrate Connect`: NPM packages that offers an innovative way to interact with Substrate-based blockchains directly in your browser. Developed by Parity in **Typescript**.",
